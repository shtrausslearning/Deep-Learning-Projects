### 1 | Introduction

- Microscopic evaluation of histopathalogic stained tissue & its **subsequent digitalisation** is now a more feasible due to the advances in slide scanning technology, as well a reduction in digital storage cost in recent years
- There are certain advantages that come with such **digitalised pathology**; including remote diagnosis, instant archival access & simplified procedure of consultations with expert pathologists

- Digitalised Analysis based on <b>Deep Learning</b> has shown potential benefits as a <b>potential diagnosis tool</b> & strategy. 
- Examples from literature:
  - [Gulshan et al](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2588763)
  - [Esteva et al](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28117445/) 
- Both these papers demonstrated the <b>potential of deep learning for diabetic retinopathy screening</b> and <b>skin lesion classification</b>, respectively
- An essential task performed by pathologist; **accurate breast cancer staging**
- Assessment of the extent of cancer spread by histopathological analysis of sentinel axillary lymph nodes (SLNs) is an essential part of breast cancer staging process
