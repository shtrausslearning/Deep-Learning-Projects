### 1 | Hummingbird monitoring

- The purpose of this project is to create an image <code>classifier</code> for hummingbird **species** and **genders** that visit feeders. 
- The ultimate goal is to have a classification system that can be deployed at any feeder, which is important to the continued monitoring of hummingbird species and bird  migration patterns. 
- Such a system is applicable to anywhere that hummingbirds migrate or breed, given additional datasets for those species.
- Hummingbird migration is otherwise reliant on individual bird watchers to see and report their observations. 
- If avid bird lovers setup a similar system, then conservation organizations would have better information on migratory and breeding patterns. 
- This knowledge can be used to determine if specific changes in the environment or ecology has positively or negatively impacted bird life.

### 2 | Reasons for turning to machine learning

- With the increased affordability of visual monitoring equipment, it has become practical for anyone to contribute to such a wonderful cause & help make each sighting more valid. 
- Often, due to <b>limitations of gear</b>, <b>poor photography/videography technique</b>, or **<span style='color:#B6DA32'>simply poor lighting conditions</span>**, it can be difficult for users, <b>let alone experts</b> to distinguish what specific bird was seen at the time of monitoring.
- In this study, we will focus our attention to a bird called the <b>hummingbird</b>. What is useful about this specie is that, despite being quite distinguishible in shape, <b>they have a variery of unique colouring</b>, which means that if images are of poor quality, it may be hard for humans or models to distinguish them.
- In the entire process of <b>expert identification</b> & dealing with various image related inconsistencies outlied previously, manual identification for monitoring can be quite labourous, so an automated system of identification can go a long way.
- In our quest to create an automated approach, we can be left with a collection or under or over exposed images that will create difficulties for the model to distinguish between different classes correctly. 

### 3 | Project goal 

- The ultimate goal is to have a **<span style='color:#B6DA32'>classification system</span>** that can address such the above stated varieties in an image & **<span style='color:#B6DA32'>correctly distinguish very similar bird species</span>**.
